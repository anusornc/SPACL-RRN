# SPACL: Speculative Parallel Tableaux with Adaptive Conflict Learning

## Overview

SPACL is a novel OWL2 DL reasoning algorithm that combines three key innovations:

1. **Speculative Parallelism** - Work-stealing parallel exploration of tableaux branches
2. **Conflict-Driven Learning** - Learns from contradictions to prune future search (like CDCL in SAT solvers)
3. **Adaptive Tuning** - Uses evolutionary optimization to dynamically adjust parallelism parameters

## Key Features

### 1. Speculative Branch Exploration

Traditional tableaux is sequential - it explores one branch at a time. SPACL:
- Spawns parallel workers to explore disjunction branches simultaneously
- Uses work-stealing (crossbeam deque) for load balancing
- Dynamically decides when to parallelize based on ontology characteristics

```rust
// When encountering A ⊔ B, explore both branches in parallel
if should_parallelize(branch_complexity) {
    spawn_parallel_exploration(branch_a, branch_b);
}
```

### 2. Conflict-Driven Learning (Nogoods)

When a branch leads to contradiction, SPACL learns a "nogood" - a set of assertions that are jointly unsatisfiable:

```rust
pub struct Nogood {
    assertions: HashSet<ClassExpression>,  // These together are UNSAT
    size: usize,
    hit_count: usize,  // For prioritization
}
```

Future branches that are supersets of a nogood are immediately pruned without exploration.

### 3. Adaptive Parallelism Tuning

Uses an `AdaptiveTuner` that adjusts the parallelization threshold based on observed speedup:

```rust
impl AdaptiveTuner {
    fn update(&self, speedup: f64) {
        // If speedup > 2: increase parallelism (lower threshold)
        // If speedup < 1: decrease parallelism (raise threshold)
    }
}
```

## API Usage

```rust
use owl2_reasoner::{
    Ontology, 
    SpeculativeTableauxReasoner, 
    SpeculativeConfig
};

// Create reasoner with custom config
let config = SpeculativeConfig {
    num_workers: 8,
    max_speculative_depth: 10,
    enable_learning: true,
    max_nogoods: 10000,
    ..Default::default()
};

let mut reasoner = SpeculativeTableauxReasoner::with_config(ontology, config);

// Check consistency
let is_consistent = reasoner.is_consistent()?;

// Get statistics
let stats = reasoner.get_stats();
println!("Branches pruned by nogoods: {}", stats.branches_pruned);
println!("Nogoods learned: {}", stats.nogoods_learned);
println!("Achieved speedup: {:.2}x", stats.speedup);
```

## Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Sequential Tableaux | SPACL |
|--------|-------------------|-------|
| Best case (highly branching) | O(2^n) | O(2^(n/p)) with p workers |
| Worst case (linear) | O(n) | O(n) + small overhead |
| Memory | O(n) | O(n * p) for p workers |
| Cache efficiency | Moderate | High (nogood pruning) |

## Theoretical Properties

### Soundness
SPACL is **sound**: If it returns "consistent", the ontology is truly consistent.
- Proof: A model is only reported when a branch completes without contradiction

### Completeness  
SPACL is **complete**: If the ontology is consistent, it will eventually find a model.
- Proof: Nogoods only prune unsatisfiable branches. The search space is a subset of the original tableaux space.

### Termination
SPACL **terminates** for finite ontologies.
- Proof: Either finds a model or exhausts all branches. Nogood pruning only removes infinite branches faster.

## Comparison with Existing Approaches

| Algorithm | Parallelism | Learning | Adaptive | Best For |
|-----------|------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Standard Tableaux | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Simple ontologies |
| Parallel Tableaux | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Regular branching |
| CDCL-based | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | Propositional logic |
| SPACL (this work) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Complex, branching OWL ontologies |

## Future Extensions

1. **GPU Acceleration** - Offload nogood checking to GPU
2. **Distributed SPACL** - Multi-node speculation across cluster
3. **Neural-guided Speculation** - Use learned heuristics to predict which branches to explore
4. **Incremental SPACL** - Reuse nogoods when ontology is modified

The algorithm draws inspiration from:
